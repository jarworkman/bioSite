        <h1>About Kirsten</h1>
        <h4>Clarkson College and Career</h4>
        <p>
          Kirsten is a full-time student nursing major at Carkson College, going
          for her RN/BSN and aspires to eventually go on after a year in the
          field to get her Nurse Practioner certification. She is also a
          full-time employee at Children's Hospital here in Omaha in the NICU as
          a CNA. She has found that she loves working with babies and wants to
          continue working in the NICU when she eventually becomes a nurse.
          Fortunately, as opposed to many other CNA positions, she is allowed a
          growing scope to keep learning and advancing, regardless of title.
        </p>
        <h4>Life and Traveling</h4>
        <p>
          Kirsten has lived most of her life here in Nebraska but in high school
          moved to Georgia and then Florida because her Mom joined the National
          Guard. Although a difficult experience for her living and going to the
          same school her whole life, she will also tell you that it was on of
          the best things for her. She really got to see things that she was
          never exposed to before and showed her there's more of a world than
          the small town she lived in. She realized that she has an incredible
          love for the ocean, and traveling in general. With such a love for the
          ocean, and just nature in general, she's spent the last couple of
          years budgeting for different "vacations", but they are mostly
          exploration missions to find the one place in the country she really
          wants to reside. She's been to both coasts, drove through many other
          states, and been to the Colorado Rockys so far, with Charleston, SC up
          next in a couple of weeks.
